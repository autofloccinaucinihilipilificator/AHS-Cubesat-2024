"""
The Python code you will write for this module should read
acceleration data from the IMU. When a reading comes in that surpasses
an acceleration threshold (indicating a shake), your Pi should pause,
trigger the camera to take a picture, then save the image with a
descriptive filename. You may use GitHub to upload your images automatically,
but for this activity it is not required.

The provided functions are only for reference, you do not need to use them. 
You will need to complete the take_photo() function and configure the VARIABLES section
